# 1. 14.1 Continuous Pool (Straight Pool)

14.1 Continuous Pool, also known as straight pool, is played with fifteen numbered balls and the cue-ball. Each ball pocketed on a legal called shot counts one point and the first player to reach the required score wins the Match. 14.1 is continuous in that after fourteen balls are pocketed, they are re-racked, and the shooter continues.

# 2 Lagging for the Break

Players lag to determine who will shoot first.

### 2.1 Lagging to Determine First Break

The lag is the first shot of the Match and determines order of play. The player who wins the lag chooses who will shoot first.

The referee will place a ball on each side of the table above the Head String and near the Head String. The players will shoot at about the same time to make each ball contact the foot cushion with the goal of returning the ball closer to the head cushion than the opponent.

A lag shot is bad and cannot win if the shooter’s ball:

1. crosses the Long String,
2. contacts the foot cushion other than once,
3. is pocketed or driven off the table,
4. touches the side cushion, or
5. the ball rests within the corner pocket and past the nose of the head cushion. In addition, a lag will be bad if any non-object-ball foul occurs

The players will lag again if:

1. a player’s ball is struck after the other ball has touched the foot cushion,
2. the referee cannot determine which ball has stopped closer to the head cushion, or
3. both lags are bad.

# 3 The Rack

For an opening break shot, the fifteen balls are racked in a triangle with the apex ball on the Foot Spot. When the balls are re-racked, the apex ball is omitted if only fourteen balls are being racked. The marked outline of the triangle will be used to determine whether an intended break ball is in the rack area. If the balls are racked without a triangle, the outline of the triangle will still be drawn for the purpose of deciding whether a ball is in the rack area. A Ball Rack Template will not be used.

# 4 Opening Break Shot

The following rules apply to the opening break shot:

1. The cue-ball begins in hand above the Head String.
2. If no called ball is pocketed, the cue-ball and two object-balls must each be driven to a rail after the cue-ball contacts the rack or the shot is a breaking foul. This is penalized by subtracting two points from the breaker’s score (see [11 Breaking Foul](#breaking-foul)). The non-breaking player may accept the balls in position or may require the breaker to play another opening break shot, until he satisfies the requirements for an opening break or the non-shooting player accepts the table in position (see [12 Serious Fouls](#serious-fouls)).

# 5 Continuing Play and Winning the Match

The shooter remains at the table as long as he continues to legally pocket called balls or wins the Match by scoring the required number of points. When fourteen balls from a rack have been legally pocketed, play is suspended until the balls are re-racked.

# 6 Shots Required to be Called

Shots must be called as explained in [6.1 Standard Call Shots](#standard-call-shot). The shooter may call “safety” in which case play passes to the opponent at the end of the shot and any object-ball pocketed on the safety is spotted.

### 6.1 Standard Call Shot

In Disciplines in which the shooter is required to call shots, the intended ball and pocket must be indicated for each shot if they are not obvious. Details of the shot, such as cushions struck or other balls contacted or pocketed are irrelevant. Only one ball may be called on each shot.

For a called shot to count, the referee must be satisfied that the intended shot was made, so if there is any chance of confusion, e.g. with bank, combination and similar shots, the shooter should indicate the ball and pocket. If the referee or opponent is unsure of the shot to be played, he may ask for a call.

In call shot Disciplines, the shooter may choose to call “safety” instead of a ball and pocket and then play passes to the opponent at the end of the shot. Whether balls are being spotted after safeties depends on the rules of the particular Discipline.

# 7 Spotting Balls

All balls pocketed on fouls, or on safeties, or without a called ball having been pocketed, and all balls driven off the table are spotted [7.1 Spotting Balls Details](#spotting-balls-details). If the fifteenth ball of a rack needs to be spotted and the fourteen balls have not been touched, the fifteenth ball will spot on the apex spot and the referee may use the triangle to assure a tight rack.

### 7.1 Spotting Balls Details

Balls are spotted (returned to play on the table) by placing them on the Long String (long axis of the table) as close as possible to the Foot Spot and between the Foot Spot and the Foot Rail, without moving any interfering ball. If the spotted ball cannot be placed on the Foot Spot, it should be placed in contact (if possible) with the corresponding interfering ball. However, when the cue-ball is next to the spotted ball, the spotted ball should not be placed in contact with the cue-ball; a small separation must be maintained. If all of the Long String below the Foot Spot is blocked by other balls, the ball is spotted above the Foot Spot, and as close as possible to the Foot Spot.

# 8 Scoring

The shooter scores one point for legally pocketing a called shot. Each additional ball pocketed on such a shot also counts one point. Fouls are penalized by subtracting points from the offending player’s score. Scores may be negative due to penalties from fouls.

# 9 Special Racking Situations

When the cue-ball or fifteenth object-ball interferes with racking fourteen balls for a new rack, the following special rules apply. A ball is considered to interfere with the rack if it is within or overlaps the outline of the rack. The referee will state when asked whether a ball interferes with the rack:

1. If the fifteenth ball was pocketed on the shot that scored the fourteenth ball, all fifteen balls are re-racked.
2. If both balls interfere, all fifteen balls are re-racked, and the cue-ball is in hand above the Head String.
3. If only the object-ball interferes, it is placed on the Head Spot or the Center Spot if the cue-ball blocks the Head Spot.
4. If only the cue-ball interferes, then it is placed as follows: if the object-ball is in front of or on the Head String, the cue-ball is in hand above the Head String; if the object-ball is above the Head String, the cue-ball is spotted on the Head Spot, or on the Center Spot if the Head Spot is blocked.

In any case, there is no restriction on which object-ball the shooter may play as the first shot of the new Rack.

If the cue-ball or object-ball is barely outside the marked rack area and it is time to rack, the referee should mark the position of the ball to allow it to be accurately replaced if it is accidently moved by the referee when racking.

| | **Cue-ball in the Rack** | **Cue-ball not in the Rack and not blocking the Head Spot** | **Cue-ball blocking the Head Spot** |
|-|-|-|-|
| **15^th^ Ball in the Rack** | 15^th^ Ball: Foot Spot<br>Cue-ball: above Head String | 15^th^ Ball: Head Spot<br>Cue-ball: in position | 15^th^ Ball: Center Spot<br>Cue-ball: in position |

# 10 Standard Fouls

If the shooter commits a standard foul, a point is subtracted from his score, balls are spotted as necessary and play passes to his opponent. The cue-ball remains in position except as noted below. The following are standard fouls at 14.1:

### 10.1 Cue-ball Scratch or off the Table.

If the cue-ball is pocketed or driven off the table, the shot is a foul. The cue-ball is in hand above the Head String

### 10.2 No Rail after Contact

If no ball is pocketed on a shot, the cue-ball must contact an object-ball, and after that contact at least one ball (cue-ball or any object-ball) must be driven to a rail, or the shot is a foul. If the cue-ball strikes a legal object-ball and a cushion at approximately the same instant, and it cannot be determined which was hit first, it will be assumed that the legal object-ball was struck first.

### 10.3 No Foot on Floor

If the shooter does not have at least one foot touching the floor at the instant the tip contacts the cue-ball, the shot is a foul.

### 10.4 Ball Driven off the Table

It is a foul to drive an object-ball off the table. All object-balls driven off the table are spotted (see [7.1 Spotting Balls Details](#spotting-balls-details)).

### 10.5 Touched Ball

It is a foul to touch, move or change the path of any object-ball except by the normal ball-to-ball contacts during shots. It is a foul to touch, move or change the path of the cue-ball except when it is in hand or by the normal tip-to-ball forward stroke contact of a shot. The shooter is responsible for the equipment he controls at the table, such as chalk, bridges, clothing, his hair, parts of his body, and the cue-ball when it is in hand, that may be involved in such fouls. If such a foul is accidental, it is a standard foul, but if it is intentional, it is Unsportsmanlike Conduct.

### 10.6 Double Hit / Frozen Balls

If the cue-stick contacts the cue-ball more than once on a shot, the shot is a foul. If the cue-ball is close to but not touching an object-ball and the cue tip is still on the cue-ball when the cue-ball contacts that object-ball, the shot is a foul. If the cue-ball is very close to an object-ball, and the shooter barely grazes that object-ball on the shot, the shot is assumed not to violate the first paragraph of this rule, even though the tip is arguably still on the cue-ball when ball-ball contact is made.

However, if the cue-ball is touching an object-ball at the start of the shot, it is legal to shoot towards or partly into that ball (provided it is a legal target within the rules of the game) and if the object-ball is moved by such a shot, it is considered to have been contacted by the cue-ball. (Even though it may be legal to shoot towards such a touching or “frozen” ball, care must be taken not to violate the rules in the first paragraph if there are additional balls close by.)

The cue-ball is assumed not to be touching any ball unless it is declared touching by the referee or opponent. It is the shooter’s responsibility to get the declaration before the shot. Playing away from a frozen ball does not constitute having hit that ball.

### 10.7 Push Shot

It is a foul to prolong tip-to-cue-ball contact beyond that seen in normal shots.

### 10.8 Balls Still Moving

It is a foul to begin a shot while any ball in play is moving or spinning.

### 10.9 Bad Cue-ball Placement

When the cue-ball is in hand and restricted to the area above the Head String, it is a foul to play the cue-ball from on or below the Head String. If the shooter is uncertain whether the cue-ball has been placed above the Head String, he may ask the referee for a determination.

### 10.10 Bad Play from Above the Head String.

When the cue-ball is in hand above the Head String, and the first ball the cue-ball contacts is also above the Head String, the shot is a foul unless the cue-ball crosses the Head String before that contact. If such a shot is intentional, it is unsportsmanlike conduct.

The cue-ball must either cross the Head String or contact a ball in front of or on the Head String or the shot is a foul, and the cue-ball is in hand for the following player (also above the Head String). If such shot is intentional, it is also unsportsmanlike conduct.

### 10.11 Playing out of Turn

It is a standard foul to unintentionally play out of turn. Normally, the balls will be played from the position left by the mistaken play. If a player intentionally plays out of turn, it is Unsportsmanlike Conduct.

### 10.12 Slow Play

If the referee feels that a player is playing too slowly, he may advise that player to speed up his play. If the player does not speed up, the referee may impose a shot clock on that Match that applies to both players. If the shooter exceeds the time limit specified for the tournament, a standard foul will be called and the incoming player is rewarded according to the rules applicable to the game being played.

### 10.13 Ball Rack Template Foul

It is a foul when a Ball Rack Template, removed from the playing surface, interferes with the game, i.e., if the template is lying on the rail, and a ball (cue-ball or object-ball) touches the template that is lying on the rail.

# 11 Breaking Foul

A breaking foul is penalized by the loss of two points as mentioned under [4 Opening Break Shot](#opening-break-shot), as well as a possible re-break. If both a standard foul and a breaking foul happen on one shot, it is considered a breaking foul.

# 12 Serious Fouls

For [12.1 Three Consecutive Fouls](#three-consecutive-fouls), only standard fouls are counted, so a breaking foul does not count as one of the three fouls. A point is subtracted for the third foul as usual, and then the additional fifteen-point penalty is subtracted, and the offending player’s consecutive foul count is reset to zero. All fifteen balls are re-racked, and the offending player is required to shoot under the requirements of the opening break.

For Unsportsmanlike Conduct, the referee will choose a penalty depending on the nature of the offense.

### 12.1 Three Consecutive Fouls

If a player fouls three times without making an intervening legal shot, it is a serious foul. 

# 13 Stalemate

If a stalemate occurs (see [13. Stalemate Details](#stalemate-details)), the players will lag again to determine who will shoot an opening break. The current point score is carried over.

### 13.1 Stalemate Details

If the referee observes that no progress is being made towards a conclusion, he will announce his decision, and each player will have three more turns at the table. Then, if the referee determines that there is still no progress, he will declare a stalemate. If both players agree, they may accept the stalemate without taking their three additional turns.
